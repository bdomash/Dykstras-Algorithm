# Dykstras-Algorithm
An implementation of Dykstra's Algorithm in Java for Comp Sci 367 (Data Structures)

Given a list of locations (vertices), and a start and finish location, this program uses Dykstra's Algorithm in order to find the shortest route. I implemented the algorithm in the Node.java and the NavigationGraph.java (the meat of the project), using a hashmap as the primary data structure.
